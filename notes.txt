1. Mine a finite number of tokens and make mining tokens after that extremely difficult so no further tokens can be mined
2. Issue a token to each voter who has registered to vote
3. They send a token to the wallet of the candidate they are voting for

Each voter is issued one token, and the token is then deposited in the candidates wallet once they have cast their vote.
